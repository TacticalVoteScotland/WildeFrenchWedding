    <div id="questions">
        <h3 class="questionHeader">Travel and Accommodation</h3>
        <div class="questionContent" id="q1Content">
        <h4>Getting to Sheffield</h4>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i></span>The nearest airports with Transatlantic flights are London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester.</li>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i></span>You can get to Sheffield directly from most major UK cities - it's two hours from London, five hours from Glasgow, and about an hour from Manchester and Birmingham.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you arrive at the station, taxis and Uber will be available, or you can take the 52 or 52a bus from the bus station.</p>
        <h4>Where to Stay</h4>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-hotel"></i></span>Most major hotel chains are located in or near the city centre. The wedding will take place in Crookes, a suburb to the north-west of the city with plenty of Airbnb and Booking.com listings. Nearby suburbs include Walkley, Hillsborough, Broomhill and Ranmoor.<br /></br>If you are not bringing a car, try to avoid staying east of the city centre as transport links are more limited.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <h3 class="questionHeader">What can I do when I'm there?</h3>
        <div class="questionContent" id="q2Content">
        <p>Sheffield is Britain's sixth biggest city, so there's plenty to do nearby! Within the city you can visit the Peace Gardens, Winter Gardens and Millennium Gallery in the City Centre, take a walk out to Forge Dam, or check out lots of eating and drinking options around Kelham Island and Hunters Bar.</p>
        <p>If you want to head out of the city, it's right next to the beautiful Peak District National Park, as well as nearby to Chatsworth House and the village of Bakewell (home of tarts).</p>
      </div>
        <h3 class="questionHeader">Wedding schedule</h3>
        <div class="questionContent" id="q3Content">
        <p>We've chosen to hold our wedding on May 24, 2026 as it's a long weekend in both the UK and Canada. We hope this lets as many people as possible come and join us!</p>
        <p>As well as the wedding day, we are planning a few optional events in the preceding days:</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul" id="schedule">
          <h4>Optional Pre-wedding Events</h4>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-champagne-glasses"></i></span><strong>Thursday, May 21</strong> - Drinks in London. <em>Location TBC.</em></li>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i></span><strong>Saturday, May 23</strong> - Ramble on Kinder Scout in the Peak District. There will be two rambles available - an easy X mile walk and a more challenging X mile hike. <em>Both walks will start at Edale Train Station and end at the Rambler Inn.</em></li>
          <h4>Wedding Day</h4>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-ring"></i></span><strong>Sunday, May 24</strong> - Our wedding! We'll be starting at 2:30pm and continuing until late!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <h3 class="questionHeader">What if I can't make it?</h3>
        <div class="questionContent" id="q4Content">
        <p>That's totally fine! It would be great if you could still fill in our form just to let us know, so we have an idea of numbers - or reach out to one of us directly.</p>
        <p>If you're based in the Pacific Northwest and can't manage the travel or time off to come across the ocean, please let us know as we will be organizing a leaving event in Vancouver before we go back home for the wedding, and we'd love to see you there instead.</p>
        <p>If there's anything we can do to make your journey easier, please reach out and let us know!</p>
